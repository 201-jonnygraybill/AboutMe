      <p>Hello, and welcome to my "About Me" page! Thank you for playing my guessing game - I hope it was informative. On the left-side navigation bar of this site, please see additional categories with other information about me that you might be interested in. Thanks again for the visit!
      <br><br>
      The point of this "About Me" page is to showcase a few of the skills that I have been learning during my time at Code Fellows. I am currently in the 201 course, learning the basics of web development. I look forward to graduating and starting the 301 course next. <br><br>Below you'll find a sample of my graphics design work.
